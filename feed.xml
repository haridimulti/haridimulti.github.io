    Perkembangan teknologi digital telah memengaruhi kebiasaan kita sehari-hari mulai dari pinjaman online, pembayaran via seluler, belanja online dan terutama investasi &amp; trading.
<br>
<br>Dengan fintech yang bertumbuh pesat di Indonesia, pelayanan menjadi lebih cepat dan efektif untuk semua lapisan masyarakat yang membutuhkan layanan keuangan dengan kesempatan sama.
<br>
<br>Handal Semesta Berjangka (HSB) adalah perusahaan yang bergerak di bidang perdagangan berjangka komoditi yang sedang berkembang di industri keuangan. HSB mengutamakan pelayanan trading terbaik kepada masyarakat Indonesia.

  <p>
    <strong>Fitur "Komunitas"</strong>&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    Tiap harinya pihaknya menerima banyak pertanyaan dari para nasabah. Kebanyakan dari mereka memiliki keingintahuan besar tentang bertrading tetapi belum memiliki pengalaman atau tidak tahu cara untuk memulainya. Untuk memfasilitasi lebih banyak nasabah ikut bertrading dan lebih cepat memahami seluk-beluk trading, HSB kini menjalin sebuah komunitas online.
<br>
<br>Dalam waktu kurang dari sebulan, lebih dari 20.000 nasabah telah berdiskusi di dalam fitur komunitas kami. Jika pendatang baru mengajukan pertanyaan, maka akan ada investor berpengalaman yang membantu menjawab.
<br>
<br>Berikut adalah beberapa contoh pertanyaan; produk apa saja yang berpeluang untuk profit hari ini? Akankah USD/JPY terus meroket? Apa pengaruh bantuan infrastruktur Biden terhadap dolar? Berapa lama pencairan di akun HSB? Dengan ini, para nasabah HSB memiliki platform untuk saling tukar informasi.
<br>
<br>Dalam proses pencapaian target trading yang diinginkan, investor harus mengasah intuisi secara mandiri, banyak belajar dan memperbaiki kesalahan dalam bertrading, namun tidak banyak orang yang benar-benar mampu melakukannya.
<br>
<br>"Sekarang, dengan hadirnya fitur komunitas ini kami harap para investor dapat berbagi pengalaman trading dan khususnya untuk trader pemula, mereka bisa melihat bagaimana cara orang lain bertrading dan belajar mengikuti langkah para trader yang lebih berpengalaman.
